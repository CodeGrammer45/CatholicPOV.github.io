Hey everyone, this is a blog for homilies from my local Catholic parish, St. Joseph's! 

I will just be breaking down homilies every week and providing reflections on them. I will keep 4 weeks of homily breakdowns
on the home page and will then have the rest stored in an archive. Stay tuned, folks!
