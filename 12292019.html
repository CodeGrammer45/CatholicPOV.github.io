        <h1>Father Joe's Homily - 12/29/2019</h1>
        
        <h2>Reading 1:    Sirach 3:2-6, 12-14</h2>
        <h2>Reading 2:    Colossians 3:12-21</h2>
        <h2>Gospel:    Matthew 2:13-15, 19-23</h2>

        <p class="main-text">
            Today, Father Joe spoke about how we are so blessed, because as Catholics, we celebrate Christmas for 8 days, otherwise known as the Christmas Octave
            We are blessed to be able to go through this journey, and especially today, to celebrate the Holy Family. Throughout all of the struggles that these
            beautiful human beings went through, they were joyful, and we should all take a page from the book they were reading (which was probably the Bible).
            <br></br>
            As per usual for him, Father Joe had 3 points to touch on during his homily, and they were these:
        </p>

        <ol style="color: maroon; text-align: justify;">
            <li>Family is essential</li>
            <li>Family helps us grow</li>
            <li>We need to look for Herod in our day</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="main-text">Let's jump into these, shall we?</p>

        <p class="main-text"> 
            1: Family is essential
        </p>
        <p class="main-text" style="margin-left: 60px;">
            We can tell by God's actions that the family is essential to our Christianity.
            God is constantly restoring the family. In so many ways throughout the Bible, God brought together families. The story of the Prodigal Son, the son
            comes back to his father, therefore, coming back to the Father, and he couldn't have done that had God not seen how essential strong families are.
            <br></br>
            When we look at it, the Trinity itself is a family! God the Father, God the Son, and the love between them: God the Holy Spirit. The family can show
            us and bring us closer to God himself.
            <br></br>
            Through baptism, we are brought into the family of God, and Father Joe explains that this is why he always starts off his homilies with "My brothers
            and sisters in our Lord, Jesus Christ."
        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
            2: Family helps us grow
        </p>
        <p class="main-text" style="margin-left: 60px;">
            Family is more than just a place to belong or a few people to come home to every night. Families help us to grow in virtue, holiness, and love.
            <br></br>
            As the Bible says, wives should be subordinate to their husbands, and husbands should love their wives the way that Christ loved the Church (Ephesians 5:22-30).
            This is not to say that husbands need to be dictators and wives need to be slaves. Father Joe used a metaphor as an explanation.
            <br></br>
            When a husband and wife are going out to a movie, and the husband wants to watch an action movie but the wife wants to watch a romantic comedy, the conversation
            should go something like this:
            <p class="main-text" style="margin-left: 120px;">
                Wife: "Ok, honey. We will watch whatever you want to watch."
                <br></br>
                Husband: "Thanks, love. Let's watch the romantic comedy."
            </p>
            <p class="main-text" style="margin-left: 60px;">
                As you can tell, this is a love of sacrifice and of submission <em>for love</em>.
            </p>

        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
            3: We need to be looking for Herod in our day
        </p>
        <p class="main-text" style="margin-left: 60px;">
            Whatever our struggles may be, we need to be on the lookout for King Herod in our own time.
            <br></br>
            Families undergo many hardships, and from the outside looking in, it may seem like there is no way the family can get through their struggle.
            Whether the issues are of a financial nature, or addictions, or any of a number of problems, we can give in to these and let them tear us and
            our families apart. We can't allow this to happen.
            <br></br>
            These issues are manageable, and just as God warned the Holy Family through an angel, we can listen to signs and warnings in our own lives of 
            impending issues before they beat down the door and take us by surprise.
            <br></br>
            We need to listen to God, love Him, and let Him love us. All through the beautiful blessing of family.
        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
            May the Holy Family pray for us so that we may imitate them in the way that we love those who are closest to us!
            <br></br>
            Amen.
        </p>
