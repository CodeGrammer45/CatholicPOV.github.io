<h1>St. Joseph's Homily Breakdowns</h1>
<body>
  <p class="main-text">
    Hey everyone! Welcome to the beautiful world of homily breakdowns from Saint Joseph's Catholic Church in Elko, NV!
    <br></br>
    Here, I will just break down the homily from each week and talk about happenings around the church. For instance, sometimes we have confirmation retreats,
    sometimes we have pancake breakfasts, it all just depends on the week, and there is always a purpose.
    <br></br>
    So stay tuned, and join me in this beautiful life here at St. Joe's!
